# Nonogram Puzzle Solver

This project is a small react application that enables you to recreate nonogram puzzles and auto-solves them.

For information about what a nonogram is, see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

It is NOT designed to enable a user to play/solve the puzzle themselves.

This solver is designed to work with 5x5, 10x10, and 15x15 grids. Not all nonogram apps conform to
these grid sizes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Tests the solver to make sure that it is working correctly.
